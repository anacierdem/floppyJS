floppyJS
========

Javascript based floppy disk image reader.

It is able to run smoothly in Google Chrome both on a server and locally. Can be upgraded to be a Chrome plugin later.

Currently working with only FAT12 images. Any help is appreciated.

The image on http://rescup.winbuilder.net/bootdisk/ is used to test the software.

Uses dTree -> http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/
